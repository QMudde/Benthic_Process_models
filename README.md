# Benthic_Process_models
Benthic Process Model code for NECCTON

Repository contians code for mechanistic process models of benthic lifeforms. 
Process models are developed for Shellfish beds (Mytilus galloprovincialis), Seaweeds (Phyllophora & Cystoseira) and Seagrass (Posidonia). Model dynamics are based on detailed, species specific ecophysiologial processes and rates.
